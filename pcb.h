	In this assignment we are creating a PCB (Process Control Block), ReadyQueue, and 
	PriorityQueue. Each is made in sequence and then used to make the next one. The PCB
	is being held within the ReadyQueue, and the PriorityQueue holds 16 ReadyQueues. 
	This is going to be used for scheduling in the final OS project.
	
	In this file we are declaring the PCB which will hold the state of the cpu when it is
	saved, as well as more information about the process such as its identification, state,
	parent, priority, position in memory, size, and channel number.
	
	This is the header file for the PCB that holds the structs of the cpu context and the 
	PCB and the declarations of the different functions.
